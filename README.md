# BikeRental_Case_Study
In this case study, I did detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on all the fields using Numpy and Pandas. Moreover, performed Hypothesis testing to check if different factors influences the Yulu customers and bike rentals.
In this project, analyzed the factors influencing the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. Leveraging Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the study involved Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing to uncover key insights. The analysis focused on analysing variables such as season, weather, and user counts to predict demand for bike rentals. Hypothesis tests (T-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square) were applied to validate the findings, with actionable recommendations provided based on the results.
